\section{Introduction}

Filesystems provide a convenient interface for the named storage of
data, and as such are ubiquitous in application programs. Filesystem
bugs expose users to the risks of data breach, corruption, loss; thus,
verifying their correctness is essential. In this work, we present an
approach towards constructing executable specifications of existing
filesystems and verifying their functional properties in a theorem
proving environment. We detail an application of this approach to the
FAT32 filesystem.

We also detail the methodology used to build up this type of
executable specification through a series of models which
incrementally add features of the target filesystem. This methodology
has the benefit of allowing the verification effort to start from
simple models which encapsulate features common to many filesystems
and are thus suitable for re-use.

\section{Related work}

Filesystem verification research has largely followed a pattern of
synthesising a new filesystem based on a specification chosen for its
ease in proving properties of interest, rather than similarity to an
existing filesystem. Our work, in contrast, follows the FAT32
specification closely. In spirit, our work is closer to previous work
which uses interactive theorem provers and explores deep functional
properties than to efforts which use non-interactive theorem provers
such as Z3 to produce fully automated proofs of simpler properties.

\subsection{Interactive theorem provers}
An early effort in the filesystem verification domain was by Bevier
and Cohen~\cite{bevier1996executable}, who specified the Synergy
filesystem and created an executable model of the same in ACL2
\cite{kaufmann2000}, down to the level of processes
and file descriptors. On the proof front, they certified their model
to preserve well-formedness of their data structures through their
various file operations; however, they did not attempt to prove, for
instance, read-over-write properties or crash consistency. Later,
Klein et al with the SeL4 project~\cite{klein2009sel4} used
Isabelle/HOL~\cite{nipkow2002isabelle} to verify a microkernel;
while their design abstracted away file operations in order to keep
their trusted computing base small, it did serve as a precursor to their
more recent COGENT project~\cite{amani2016cogent}. Here the authors
built a "verified compiler" of sorts, generating C-language code from
specifications in their domain-specific in a manner guaranteed to
avoid many common filesystem bugs. Elsewhere, the SibylFS
project~\cite{ridge2015sibylfs}, again using Isabelle/HOL, provided
an executable specification for filesystems at a level of abstraction
that could function across multiple operating systems including OSX
and Unix. The Coq prover \cite{bertot2013interactive} has also been
used, for instance, for FSCQ
\cite{DBLP:conf/usenix/ChenZCCKZ16}, a state-of-the art filesystem
which was built to have high performance and formally verified crash
consistency properties.

\subsection{Non-interactive theorem provers}
Non-interactive theorem provers such as Z3 \cite{de2008z3}
have also been used; Hyperkernel
\cite{Nelson:2017:HPV:3132747.3132748} is a recent effort which
focusses on simplifying the xv6 microkernel until the point that Z3
can verify it with its SMT solving techniques. However, towards this
end, all system calls in Hyperkernel are replaced with analogs which
can terminate in constant time; while this approach is theoretically
sound, it increases the chances of discrepancies between the model and
the implementation which may diminish the utility of the proofs or
even render them moot. A stronger effort in the same domain is
Yggdrasil~\cite{sigurbjarnarson2016push}, which focusses on verifying
filesystems with the use of Z3. While the authors make substantial
progress in terms of the number of filesystem calls they support and
the crash consistency guarantees they provide, they are subject to
the limits of SMT solving which prevent them from modelling essential
filesystem features such as extents, which are central to many
filesystems including FAT32.

\section{Ancillary files}

Authors may upload ancillary files to be linked alongside their paper.
These can for instance contain raw data for tables and plots in the
article, or program code.  Ancillary files are included with an EPTCS
submission by placing them in a directory \texttt{anc} next to the
main latex file. See also \url{https://arxiv.org/help/ancillary_files}.
Please add a file README in the directory \texttt{anc}, explaining the
nature of the ancillary files, as in
\url{http://eptcs.org/paper.cgi?226.21}.

\section{Prefaces}

Volume editors may create prefaces using this very template,
with {\tt $\backslash$title$\{$Preface$\}$} and {\tt $\backslash$author$\{\}$}.

\section{Bibliography}

We request that you use
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcs.bst}
{\tt $\backslash$bibliographystyle$\{$eptcs$\}$}
\cite{bibliographystylewebpage}, or one of its variants
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcsalpha.bst}{eptcsalpha},
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcsini.bst}{eptcsini} or
\href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcsalphaini.bst}{eptcsalphaini}
\cite{bibliographystylewebpage}. Compared to the original {\LaTeX}
{\tt $\backslash$biblio\-graphystyle$\{$plain$\}$},
it ignores the field {\tt month}, and uses the extra
bibtex fields {\tt eid}, {\tt doi}, {\tt ee} and {\tt url}.
The first is for electronic identifiers (typically the number $n$
indicating the $n^{\rm th}$ paper in an issue) of papers in electronic
journals that do not use page numbers. The other three are to refer,
with life links, to electronic incarnations of the paper.

\paragraph{DOIs}

Almost all publishers use digital object identifiers (DOIs) as a
persistent way to locate electronic publications. Prefixing the DOI of
any paper with {\tt http://dx.doi.org/} yields a URI that resolves to the
current location (URL) of the response page\footnote{Nowadays, papers
  that are published electronically tend
  to have a \emph{response page} that lists the title, authors and
  abstract of the paper, and links to the actual manifestations of
  the paper (e.g.\ as {\tt dvi}- or {\tt pdf}-file). Sometimes
  publishers charge money to access the paper itself, but the response
  page is always freely available.}
of that paper. When the location of the response page changes (for
instance through a merge of publishers), the DOI of the paper remains
the same and (through an update by the publisher) the corresponding
URI will then resolve to the new location. For that reason a reference
ought to contain the DOI of a paper, with a life link to the corresponding
URI, rather than a direct reference or link to the current URL of
publisher's response page. This is the r\^ole of the bibtex field {\tt doi}.
{\bf EPTCS requires the inclusion of a DOI in each cited paper, when available.}

DOIs of papers can often be found through
\url{http://www.crossref.org/guestquery};\footnote{For papers that will appear
  in EPTCS and use \href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/eptcs.bst}
  {\tt $\backslash$bibliographystyle$\{$eptcs$\}$} there is no need to
  find DOIs on this website, as EPTCS will look them up for you
  automatically upon submission of a first version of your paper;
  these DOIs can then be incorporated in the final version, together
  with the remaining DOIs that need to found at DBLP or publisher's webpages.}
the second method {\it Search on article title}, only using the {\bf
surname} of the first-listed author, works best.  
Other places to find DOIs are DBLP and the response pages for cited
papers (maintained by their publishers).

\paragraph{The bibtex fields {\tt ee} and {\tt url}}

Often an official publication is only available against payment, but
as a courtesy to readers that do not wish to pay, the authors also
make the paper available free of charge at a repository such as
\url{arXiv.org}. In such a case it is recommended to also refer and
link to the URL of the response page of the paper in such a
repository.  This can be done using the bibtex fields {\tt ee} or {\tt
url}, which are treated as synonyms.  These fields should \textbf{not} be used
to duplicate information that is already provided through the DOI of
the paper.
You can find archival-quality URL's for most recently published papers
in DBLP---they are in the bibtex-field {\tt ee}---but please suppress
repetition of DOI information. In fact, it is often
useful to check your references against DBLP records anyway, or just find
them there in the first place.

\paragraph{Typesetting DOIs and URLs}

When using {\LaTeX} rather than {\tt pdflatex} to typeset your paper, by
default no linebreaking within long URLs is allowed. This leads often
to very ugly output, that moreover is different from the output
generated when using {\tt pdflatex}. This problem is repaired when
invoking \href{http://eptcs.web.cse.unsw.edu.au/breakurl.sty}
{\tt $\backslash$usepackage$\{$breakurl$\}$}: it allows linebreaking
within links and yield the same output as obtained by default with
{\tt pdflatex}. 
When invoking {\tt pdflatex}, the package {\tt breakurl} is ignored.

Please avoid using {\tt $\backslash$usepackage$\{$doi$\}$}, or
{\tt $\backslash$newcommand$\{\backslash$doi$\}$}.
If you really need to redefine the command {\tt doi}
use {\tt $\backslash$providecommand$\{\backslash$doi$\}$}.

The package {\tt $\backslash$usepackage$\{$underscore$\}$} is
recommended to deal with underscores in DOIs. This is not needed when
using {\tt $\backslash$usepackage$\{$breakurl$\}$} and not {\tt pdflatex}.

\paragraph{References to papers in the same EPTCS volume}

To refer to another paper in the same volume as your own contribution,
use a bibtex entry with
\begin{center}
  {\tt series    = $\{\backslash$thisvolume$\{5\}\}$},
\end{center}
where 5 is the submission number of the paper you want to cite.
You may need to contact the author, volume editors or EPTCS staff to
find that submission number; it becomes known (and unchangeable)
as soon as the cited paper is first uploaded at EPTCS\@.
Furthermore, omit the fields {\tt publisher} and {\tt volume}.
Then in your main paper you put something like:

\noindent
{\small \tt $\backslash$providecommand$\{\backslash$thisvolume$\}$[1]$\{$this
  volume of EPTCS, Open Publishing Association$\}$}

\noindent
This acts as a placeholder macro-expansion until EPTCS software adds
something like

\noindent
{\small \tt $\backslash$newcommand$\{\backslash$thisvolume$\}$[1]%
  $\{\{\backslash$eptcs$\}$ 157$\backslash$opa, pp 45--56, doi:\dots$\}$},

\noindent
where the relevant numbers are pulled out of the database at publication time.
Here the newcommand wins from the providecommand, and {\tt \small $\backslash$eptcs}
resp.\ {\tt \small $\backslash$opa} expand to

\noindent
{\small \tt $\backslash$sl Electronic Proceedings in Theoretical Computer Science} \hfill and\\
{\small \tt , Open Publishing Association} \hfill .

\noindent
Hence putting {\small \tt $\backslash$def$\backslash$opa$\{\}$} in
your paper suppresses the addition of a publisher upon expansion of the citation by EPTCS\@.
An optional argument like
\begin{center}
  {\tt series    = $\{\backslash$thisvolume$\{5\}[$EPTCS$]\}$},
\end{center}
overwrites the value of {\tt \small $\backslash$eptcs}.

\nocite{*}
